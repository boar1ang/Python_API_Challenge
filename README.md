# Python_API_Challenge
This is a repo containing my solutions to the Python API Challenge assignments.

## Part I: What's the weather like?
The first task was to create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ randomly-selected cities around the world. Using the OpenWeather API I collected data points for each city and displayed them in a dataframe. Then I built a series of scatter plots to show relationships between latitude and temperature, latitude and humidity, latitude and cloudiness, and latitude and wind speed.
